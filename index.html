  <title>Hangman Game in Coffee theme</title>
  
  <!-- Randy's Notes:
  Setup the game state
    
  *Use a JS object to track state

  Game needs to generate a word from a list
  
  *Lazily, start with a word

  We need to accept user input to guess the word
  
  *Use the prompt function to get user input

  We need to keep track of the number of guesses

  *Add user guesses to an array

  We need to compare the user guesses to the game word

  * I have no idea right now

  We need to show the user their game status

  Render a scoreboard on the page


Object:
  var gameState = {
    gameWord: "zebra",
    currentGuesssedLetter: "",
    currentGuessedWord: "",
    numberOfGuesses: 0;
  };

  document.onkeyup = function(event) {
    var guessedLetter = "a";
    gameState.currentGuessedLetter = guessedLetter;
    gameState.numberOfGuesses++;
    renderScoreboard();
  };


  function renderScoreboard() {
    var scoreboard document.getElementById("scoreboard");
    scoreboard.innerHTML = gameState.numberOfGuesses;
  }
  

  <div class="scoreboard"></div>

  <!--Pseudocode:
  Summary: A one page program that displays a themed hangman title and interactive hangman game. The game will consist of randomly generated dashed lines that reveal letter(s) upon correct letter guesses from the user. If the user does not guess correctly, the guess letter is revealed in a letters already guessed section. In addition, the number of guesses remaining is a number (possbily randomly generated depending on word) that will decrease for each incorrect user guess.
  
  /////////////////////////

  Rules: The user has to guess a letter.
  If the user guesses a correct letter, the user gets +1 score on wins
  If the user does not guess correctly, the users gets +1 score on losses
  The user has a limited number of guesses: the number of guesses will update
  Your Guesses So Far: displays the specific letters that the user typed. These are displayed until the user either wins or loses and refreshes in number. If the player loses, the game will reset the number of wins and losses to 0.

  Extras: There is a section on the page that displays images, the image will change depending upon the word being guess(may act as a hint). There is a changing subtitle that is related to the last correctly answered word -->
